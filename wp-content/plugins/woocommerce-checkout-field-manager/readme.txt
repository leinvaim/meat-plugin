/*
Plugin Name: Checkout Field Manager for WooCommerce
*/

The Checkout Field Manager for WooCommerce is the perfect way to customize the checkout process using an intuitive admin screen. Not only can you alter the 
order that the fields appear, but you can also add a variety of additional fields that might make more sense to your particular store. Once you add a new 
field to the checkout, the new data appears in order emails to the customer, admin and the admin order management screens. 

Once you add the extension, you'll be able to add the following types of new fields:
1. Text Input 	- great for just collecting some more information
2. Text Area  	- great for collecting alot of information
3. Checkbox		- ideal for yes or no question
4. Datepicker  	- perfect for delivery dates
5. Select		- give your customers a few options to choose from
6. Radio		- For when the Select isn't quite what you need



#Installation:
Installation is handled just like any other Wordpress Plugin. 
1. In your Wordpress admin section, go to the Plugins tab. 
2. Click Add New, and upload the zip file. 
3. Once the file is uploaded, activate the newly created Checkout Field Manager for WooCommerce plugin. 

Thats it for installation, now you just need to setup the plugin from your WooCommerce Settings page. 

#Setup
Once the plugin has been installed, you'll see a new sub menu item under WooCommerce called "Checkout Fields" - this is where you'll find the new checkout 
field manager. When you click this link, you'll be taken to the extension's setup page. Here you'll find three tabs: Billing, Shipping, and Settings. The
billing and shipping tab allow you to add / edit billing and shipping fields, while the settings tab contains an advanced option, which we'll describe next. 

#Advanced Settings
By default, the Checkout Field Manager for WooCommerce allows you to add new fields and disable NON-REQUIRED core fields (the ones that don't have the red
asterick next to them). The reason why we do this is becaus disabling core fields - or making them not required - might interfere with payment gateways, 
shipping methods or other extensions that look to the existance of the data that those fields collect. However, we do provide an ovveride switch on the 
Settings tab. If you check the box to enable the editing of these required fields, you'll have greater control over these fields. 

**Important Message ** 
If you do decide to edit the core required fields, support for any problems you might experience with payment gateways, shipping methods, and other 
extensions will be limited. If you have questions about whether disabling a required field will disrupt another extension, it's best to ask that extension 
author if the field is required.
